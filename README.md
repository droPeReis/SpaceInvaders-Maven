  Scuffed game created using maven tools that simulates the famous "Space Invaders" from 1978. This was the last challenge at my OOP UNI classes and since my teacher aproved it, then it might be usefull for someone else.
  To play i just exe the main class. 
  Controls are the keys, enter and space.
